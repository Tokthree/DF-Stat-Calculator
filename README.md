# DF-Stat-Calculator
A new stat calculator for Dead Frontier 3D.

Currently in development. All of the major features are implemented and it is styled to somewhat match Dead Frontier Profiler.
Current Implemented Features:
  - Level, Class, Stat, Proficiency and Equipment Enhancement entry.
  - Stat Point, Proficiency Point and Level Requirement display.
  - Armor and Weapon selection.
  - Detailed information regarding Character, Armor and Weapon statistics (Health, Speed, DPS, etc.)
  - Armor Effective Durability display based on IDR and Absorption.
  - DPH stat for Explosive weapons when hitting max targets.
  - Cleave information for Melee weapons.
  - Implant, GM, UB and Clan Boost selection/entry.
  - Implant Slot hiding based on entered Level.
  - Ability to "unlock" implant slots if a user just wants to calculate their boosts.
  - Implant Selection based on exclusivity of Selected Implants (e.g. no Versatility with Jack of All, no duplicates of Unique Implants).
  - Removal of implant bonuses when slot disabled.
  - Total boost display.
  - Real-time calculation of all displayed values.
  - Build selection, allowing the user to select from a range of pre-made builds submitted by the community.
  - Build guides which provide an explaination for the stats the user sees when using a build.
  - Profession descriptions which provide an explaination of a profession's pros and cons, as well as mechanics for production/service professions.
  - Ability to reset a specific panel's values, or reset all values.
  - Session storage which allows users to refresh the page without losing their build. Can be reset via the "reset everything" button

Current Missing & Planned Features:
  - Ability to export current build values as a formatted text file.

Current Known Issues:
  - UI lacking responsiveness to certain changes.
  - UI lacking responsiveness overall.

Current Best Implementation Features:
  - Resetting all values forces a page refresh, no cheap way to do so otherwise.

Current Focus:
  - Code refactoring.
  - UI overall styling & design.
