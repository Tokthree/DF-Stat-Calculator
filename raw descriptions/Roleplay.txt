Roleplay classes are called such because they do not provide any explicit stat bonuses to the character.
The only bonus provided by roleplay classes is a 30% boost to "base" experience, this makes them a popular choice as it drastically reduces the time taken to level, especially early on. As an example, a character with no experience bonus will need to kill 1,225 basic zombies to go from level 1 to level 10. A roleplay character, however, will have to kill 943 basic zombies to go from level 1 to level 10. This is not a perfect comparison as there are other ways to gain experience, however it shows that there is potentially significant benefits when grinding. Additionally, the experience bonus is applied to "base" experience. This means that while a regular player with 100% experience bonus from implants will receive 30 experience for killing a basic zombie, a player with a roleplay class and the same experience bonus will receive 39 experience. This gap gets even bigger later in the game.

Because of the experience bonus, roleplay classes are versatile and very popular with players at all stages of the game.
